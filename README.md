# D3 - Green CPU

### Custom 16-bit RISC-V Style Processor Core

The objective of this project is to design and implement a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and its corresponding processor using Verilog HDL. The ISA must be defined such that all instructions are 16 bits wide, and the processor includes 8 General Purpose Registers (GPRs).
